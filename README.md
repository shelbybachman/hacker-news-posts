In this project, I used [data](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) from the site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) to explore submissions to the site. I found that question-oriented posts, rather than posts showcasing something, received more comments on average. In examining the times of day that posts received the most average comments, both types of posts received more comments later in the day.
